        How it all started..
    </h2>
   <p>
    Never having done anything CSE,I was scared how I would crack it in such a competetive club. This club was 'the' 
    coding culture of SNU. I knew coding was not my strength. I could barely do it in school, how was I suppose to compete 
    with people who had been doping the same thin g for the past 8 years. And thats when I heard this club had a marketing team. 
    Being a student in school who was always involved in major extra-ciriicular activities, I often organised many events 
    in school. I knew I had to play to my strengths. I did it, I got into the marketing team of this club. 
    Scared of not knowing what to expect, I saw many of peers get into the cp team and the dev team, something I wish
    I could do. Either way, I knew that at least I had made it into the club and now I could learn from my peers and my seniors. 
    I grabbed the opportunity and made the best of it.
